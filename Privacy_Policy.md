we request within the app and why we need them.


###Information we collect
The information collected in Opengur is minimal.

Crashlytics for review. The data collected in this process is where within the app crashed, what type of device you were using, including
make, model, Android version, orientation of the device, available RAM and Disk Space on the device.

Crash data collected helps us indentify issues within the app not found before release and allows us to fix them and provide a better
crash free experience. This can be turned off whenever via the settings page of the app.

you to quikcly and easily return to previous searches. This data can be cleared whenever via the settings page of the app.

Your unique account token is stored locally in order to allow your account access to persist. This enables Opengur to keep your account
logged in indefinitely for quick access to your "Imgur" account and the content you care about. Your login information (username/password)
is not stored anywhere within the app or the device.
